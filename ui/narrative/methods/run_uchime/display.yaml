	<p>This is a Narrative Method for running <a href="http://drive5.com/usearch/manual/uchime_algo.html">UCHIME</a>.
	UCHIME is public domain software for detecting chimeric sequences.
	 </p>
	 <br>
	 We have packaged both the latest public domain version of UCHIME (4.2.40) and also the reimplemented version of UCHIME that's part of <a href="https://github.com/torognes/vsearch">VSEARCH</a> version 2.3.0.
	 <br>
	 UCHIME does not recognize paired reads, so you will need to merge paired reads before running chimera detection.  This method works on single end reads or a read set.
	 <br>
	 In both programs, we run the <i>de novo</i> chimera detection algorithm.  This requires that your reads file include abundance data, which must be given by a string ;size=xxx; somewhere in the label.  If this string is not present, your reads will be de-replicated and the abundance of each sequence calculated for you.
